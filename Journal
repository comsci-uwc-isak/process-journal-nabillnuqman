28/09/19 - Just created journal, Today we given several challenges. The first challenge was to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to 200. I learned that the sum was the number of terms multiplied by the average of the first and last terms. Afterwards we were given a collection of letters and words that we had to decipher. I discovered ROT 13, basically the way it worked was replacing each letter with 13th letter after it. The words decoded revealed "What is essential is invisible to the eye. See library checkout computer Happy.jpg" which lead us to go the library computer. I learned that we could use terminal to open files. We used terminal to open Happy.jpg, which revealed the last message. We did not time left afterwards to finish the challenge.
02/10/19 - I learned about the context for which a new system is planned, which may be to increase productivity or minimize costs, and to anticipate issues that might occur, a feasibility test should be conducted. There should be 5 feasibility test conducted, which was Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational, and Schedule. Afterwards, I learned basic commands that can be used in Terminal. E.g who, pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, echo, rm, ifconfig, mv, and more. The few things I thought were useful was creating and moving files, deleting files, and checking my ip. I was also taught the beginning of programming using Terminal using nano. Something that I thought was interesting was that each digit in an IP address could only go up to 256.
